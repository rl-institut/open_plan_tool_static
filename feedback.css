/* All steps 
Move info text to box such as done in `scenario-creation-1.html`

/* Step 3 
Remove `btn--transparent` class from "Add consumer group" 

/* Step 3 
Add `btn--secondary` class to button "Reset the questionnaire"

/* Step 7
Add `cpn-accordion` CSS class to div that has `accordionQuestions` as ID.
It should update the color of the accordion buttons to a new one, as I just did on `cpn-step.3.html' (so check there if you're not sure or if this is not working)
